# 🏎️ F1App

A hobby project that displays Formula 1 data like drivers, tracks, and more.  
This app is built with Kotlin and Android technologies and powered by the open-source [jolpica-f1](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1) API.

> ⚠️ This project is under development and evolves as I explore new ideas, improve architecture, and add new features.

## 🚧 Features

## 🔌 API
